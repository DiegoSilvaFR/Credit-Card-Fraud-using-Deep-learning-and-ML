Fraud Detection in Credit Transactions - Case Study
This is a case study that focuses on the detection of fraud in credit transactions using machine learning techniques. The study utilized four different machine learning models, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and an Ensemble Voting model that combines predictions from all the models together.

Objective
The main objective of this case study was to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in detecting fraud in credit transactions. By using multiple models, the study aimed to identify the best-performing model that could effectively detect fraud and potentially improve the accuracy, robustness, and generalization of the detection system.

Methodology
The study utilized a dataset of credit transactions that included features such as transaction amount, location, time, and other relevant information. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. Then, the dataset was split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation, respectively.

Four machine learning models were employed in this study:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple yet effective algorithm that classifies a data point based on the class labels of its k-nearest neighbors.
Random Forest: A popular ensemble learning method that builds a collection of decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness.
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): A type of artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers that can learn complex patterns in data.
Ensemble Voting: A combination of predictions from multiple models, including KNN, Random Forest, and DNNs, using a voting scheme to make final predictions.
The models were trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study compared the performance of the individual models and the Ensemble Voting model to determine the best-performing model.

Results
The results of the case study showed that the Ensemble Voting model achieved the best performance in terms of fraud detection. It outperformed the individual models, including KNN, Random Forest, and DNNs, in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest model also performed well, followed by the KNN model.

Conclusion
The case study demonstrated that the Ensemble Voting model, which combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models, can achieve better results in detecting fraud in credit transactions compared to individual models. The diversity of the models and their ability to capture different aspects of the data likely contributed to the improved performance of the Ensemble Voting model. This case study highlights the potential of using ensemble methods for fraud detection in credit transactions and suggests further research and experimentation with different ensemble techniques to improve fraud detection accuracy and robustness.
